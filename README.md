# From Nand To Tetris
Building a general purpose computer system from the ground up!
This project contains my implementation of a computer based on the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Shocken (MIT Press).

### First Part: Hardware
The first 5 sections of this project envolve developing the computer hardware in HDL:
- Basic logic chips
- More complex components such as ALU and registers
- A complete computer with RAM and CPU.

### Second Part: Software
Section 6-8 and 10-11 envolve designing and implementing the computer software:
- Assembler
- Compiler
- Operating system

### Third Part: "Cars" Game
In section 9, we developed an interactive game to run on the computer system we built. The game was designed from scratch based on common OOP principles, and it showcases the power and versatility of the computer we constructed.
